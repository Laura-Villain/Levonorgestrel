The PBPK model for levonorgestrel was developed and verified with clinical pharmacokinetic data.

The model was evaluated covering data from studies including in particular

* intravenous administration of levonorgestrel from 0.03 to 0.25 mg
* oral administration of levonorgestrel in fasted and fed state from 0.03 to 1.5 mg 

The model quantifies metabolism of levonorgestrel by CYP3A4 and considers binding of levonorgestrel to albumin and SHBG.

The next sections show:

1. the final model parameters for the building blocks: [Section 3.1](#final-input-parameters).
2. the overall goodness of fit: [Section 3.2](#diagnostics-plots).
3. simulated vs. observed concentration-time profiles for the clinical studies used for model building and for model verification: [Section 3.3](#ct-profiles).
