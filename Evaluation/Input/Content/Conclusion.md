The herein presented PBPK model adequately describes the pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel in adults.

In particular, it describes kinetic binding of levonorgestrel to albumin and SHBG, as well as metabolism by CYP3A4. Thus, the model is fit for purpose to be applied for the investigation of drug-drug interactions with regard to inhibition of CYP3A4.
