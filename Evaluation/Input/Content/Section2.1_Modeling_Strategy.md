The general concept of building a PBPK model has previously been described by Kuepfer et al. ([Kuepfer 2016](#main-references)) The relevant anthropometric (height, weight) and physiological parameters (e.g. blood flows, organ volumes, binding protein concentrations, hematocrit, cardiac output) in adults was gathered from the literature and has been previously published ([PK-Sim Ontogeny Database Version 7.3](#main-references)). The information was incorporated into PK-Sim® and was used as default values for the simulations in adults.

The applied activity and variability of plasma proteins and active processes that are integrated into PK-Sim® are described in the publicly available PK-Sim® Ontogeny Database Version 7.3 ([Schlender 2016](#main-references)) or otherwise referenced for the specific process.

First, a PBPK model for levonogestrel was developed and evaluated for a healthy adult volunteers for IV and oral administration. The mean PBPK model was developed using a standard female individual. The model was evaluated by comparing the pharmacokinetic simulation with observed in vivo pharmacokinetic data taken from literature. The current levonogestrel model is based on the publication by Cicali et al [Cicali 2021](#main-references).

Unknown parameters were identified using the Parameter Identification module provided in PK-Sim®. Structural model selection was mainly guided by visual inspection of the resulting description of data and biological plausibility.

Once the appropriate structural model was identified, additional parameters for tablet formulations were identified. 

The model was then verified by simulating:

- IV administration
- Oral administration in fasted state
- Oral administration in fed state

Details about input data (physicochemical, *in vitro* and clinical) can be found in  [Section 2.2](#methods-data).

Details about the structural model and its parameters can be found in  [Section 2.3](#model-parameters-and-assumptions).
