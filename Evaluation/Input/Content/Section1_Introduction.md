Levonorgestrel is a synthetic progestogen present in many progestin-based hormonal contraceptives. LNG formulations
include progestin-only pills, subdermal implants, intrauterine devices, combined hormonal contraceptives, and emergency contraception  ([Cicali 2021](#main-references)) . 

Levonorgestrel is cleared by cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4) as well as phase II enzymes, including uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase or
sulfotransferases.

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for levonorgestrel in (healthy) adults.

The presented levonorgestrel PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source ([https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Levonorgestrel-Model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Levonorgestrel-Model)).
