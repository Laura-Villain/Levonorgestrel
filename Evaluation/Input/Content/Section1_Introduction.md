Levonorgestrel (LNG) is a synthetic progestogen present in many progestin-based hormonal contraceptives. LNG formulations
include progestin-only pills, subdermal implants, intrauterine devices, combined hormonal contraceptives, and emergency contraception ([Cicali 2021](#main-references)) . 

LNG is a biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) class I compound at the doses of interest, it is completely
absorbed and demonstrates almost complete bioavailability ([Back 1981](#main-references)). LNG is cleared by cytochrome P450-3A4 (CYP3A4) as well as phase II enzymes, including uridine 5’-diphosphoglucuronosyltransferase or sulfotransferases. LNG is extensively bound to plasma proteins (~97.5%), primarily the sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and to less extent albumin ([Back 1981](#main-references)), ([FDA 2017](#main-references)).

The herein presented model building and evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for LNG in (healthy) women. The PBPK model of LNG has been developed and evaluated by comparing simulations to observed data of both intravenously and orally (fasted/fed state) administered levonorgestrel covering a dosing range from 0.03 to 1.5 mg.

The presented levonorgestrel PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source ([https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Levonorgestrel-Model](https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/Levonorgestrel-Model)).
